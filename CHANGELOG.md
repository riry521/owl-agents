# Changelog

## 1.0.0 - 2026-10-07

First public release. It establishes the safety and installability needed for v1 and ships the full feature set below.

### Safety and installation

- Auto-load `.env`, with explicit process environment variables taking precedence
- `OWL_BIND`, loopback default, and a required Bearer token for external bind / Tailscale Serve
- Made Tailscale Serve an explicit opt-in
- Made the stub provider require no external CLI, and cleaned up doctor/setup provider detection into a selectable form
- Made `OWL_DATA_DIR` the common root for the DB, logs, settings, and the connector Vault
- Made the legacy `.owl-data` backward-compatible via a safe missing-file-only migration
- Treat the doctor check on a fresh data directory as a `not_initialized` warning
- Documented the macOS/Linux support range, Windows unsupported/experimental status, backup/restore, and known limitations
- Added root typecheck/test/audit scripts and CI


### Providers and connectors

- `codex` provider alongside Claude, with Codex session drivers and plan-usage reporting
- Slack and Discord connectors (`@owl/connector-slack`, `@owl/connector-discord`) and the `@owl/plugin-sdk` package for plugins loaded via `OWL_PLUGINS_FILE`
- When a provider returns 429, Owl pauses that provider and resumes automatically

### Web UI

- Pages for the board, backlog, decisions, knowledge, rules and approvals, skills, tokens, activity, agents, projects, archive, and settings, plus an Advisor chat page

### Works and planning

- Per-project repair backlog (`/backlog` API): link, dismiss, delete, and issue a Work from an item
- Draft Works that are created but not started until confirmed
- `design_mode` and the Lead Designer role for design Tasks
- The Advisor can operate Works (including cancel and delete), and the `owl advisor` command talks to it from the terminal
- Defined behavior for cancelling and deleting Works
- The web UI shows Core's background processing: integration verification, re-verification before merge, and waiting for merge
- Automatic build after merge
- Remake limits (`remake_limits` setting), including Reviewer rejections of Lead Designer output (`lead_review_rejections`)
- Task prerequisite resume API (`/tasks/:id/prerequisite/resume`)

### Knowledge and rules

- owl-memory: an MCP server, an index, and a Librarian that curates knowledge pages
- Default rule files under `rules/` (system and role defaults) are tracked in git; other rule files stay local

Known limitations are documented in [README.md](README.md) and [docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md).
